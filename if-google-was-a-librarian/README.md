# Google Books React JS and Heroku Search

## What if Google Was a Librarian?

This was the final individual project for the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This app uses React JS and Heroku Deployment to search Google Books' API and return objects using Node and React JS configurations. Users can then save books or explore those searched books more thoroughly in the app itself.

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone
Navigate over to the terminal and open up the area around server.js in the terminal. Then type:
npm install
After all dependencies are loaded, then type:
npm start

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

For remote viewing, my app is on Heroku at:

## Technologies Used

This application follows MERN deployment principles with MVP file and folder structuring. This application relies upon React JS connected through Heroku and uses Mongo Mongoose to communicate with mLab MongoDB for database use in production with Express for the engine. Other dependenices include Path for assistance in routing, some JQuery and a lot of Axios for rendering, and Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, ReactStrap and some @material-ui for assistance in rendering and other elements.
